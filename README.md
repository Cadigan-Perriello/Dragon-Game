# Dragon-Game
Dragon Class:
This basic class models a dragon fighting game. A dragon has a self inputted name, color, and size. It also has a health variable that starts at 100 and a kills parameter that begins at 0 as well as a boolean of fire-breather. If a drgaon attacks you and they are a fire-breather you lose the fight and lose 20 health points. If the dragons are both fire-breathers or not, the size determines who wins. Your dragon is dead if the health hits 0.
